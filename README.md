# AguilarFMiniChallenge1

Recreated our Mini Challenge 1 from the combine, including data validation. The program asks the user to input their name, the prints it back to them in a hardcoded greeting that includes the user input.

Peer Reviewed By:Elizar Garcia, This was honestly on of my favorites so far. short and simple but also unique. The code worked greatly and really pulled me into a different world. Adding the "watcher" and his banter really gave this project some style. Very good job four thumbs up sir.
